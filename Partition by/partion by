### Getting aggregative data

SELECT Gender, AVG(Salary), MAX(Salary), MIN(Salary)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Gender

## Getting both non-aggregative data and aggregative data
SELECT Name, Salary, Gender
COUNT(Gender) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) AS GendersTotals,
AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) AS AvgSal,
MAX(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) AS MaxSal,
Min(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) AS MinSal;
FROM Employees
